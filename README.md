# better-handsup
This is an improved/fixed version of KadDarem's walkable handsup script which you can find here -> https://github.com/KadDarem/Walkable-Hands-Up

This version basically stops your ped from doing the hands up animation if you are in a vehicle. This is to prevent conflict with the animation that makes your ped cover himself in a car (default key 'X'). This could simply be achievable by re-mapping the handsup key to other than 'X' but for me it wasn't enough as I didn't want people to raise their hands in the car as it looks wonky.

Default Key is 'X' and you can edit it on line 24.
